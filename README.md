# integrating and analyzing multiple global datasets related to population, life expectancy, and infant mortality.

Project Description

This project focuses on integrating and analyzing multiple global datasets related to population, life expectancy, and infant mortality. The main objective is to uncover meaningful demographic and health-related patterns through interactive Power BI dashboards.

The solution enables users to visually explore and compare key global indicators using dynamic charts, maps, and analytical filters, supporting data-driven insights across continents and countries.

🎯 Project Objectives

Integrate demographic and public health datasets into a structured data model.

Develop two interactive reports for exploratory and comparative analysis:

Report 1: Population distribution by country and continent.

Report 2: Global indicators of Life Expectancy and Infant Mortality.

Enable detailed analysis through segmentation, drill-downs, and ranked grouping.

📊 Analysis by Categories

The dashboards allow comparisons and insights across several analytical dimensions:

Continent and country segmentation

Population groups (ranked from highest to lowest)

Life Expectancy groups (ranked)

Infant Mortality groups (ranked)

Correlation between Life Expectancy vs. Infant Mortality
